# Read Me

Welcome to my [[Commonplace Book]] – my personal notebook, or [digital garden](https://maggieappleton.com/garden-history). It's a way to download my knowledge into a digital format for easy sharing and remembering.

Maintaining this is about sharing the ideas that I'm exploring and to think in public. This means that, unlike a traditional blog, I'm showcasing many ideas that are in development rather than complete. The purpose is to learn, remember what I’ve learned, and apply what I’ve learned.

My notes are in various stages of completion, but none of them are complete. They are all subject to change. 

I'm using [Obsidian Publish](https://obsidian.md/publish) to organize my thoughts and I'm slowly migrating old content and updating formatting, as well as adding new content. I have a lot of interesting snippets that I've collected over the years. Lots of good ideas to explore and connect. It is just going to take some time.


## How this works

There is no single linear path through these notes.

You can find interconnections among the notes using the interactive graph, tables of content and backlinks. The sidebar organises notes according to a logic that makes sense to me.

This site is a collection of interconnected notes, somewhat similar to an old-fashioned [wiki](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wiki). It is non-linear and there is no strict hierarchy to be followed. Ideas crash and bump into each other through internal hyperlinks. New content is added wherever it is added and there is no documentation for when it was added. The reader can jump in anywhere that seems interesting and find their own path. There are many areas that feel filled in, while others have notes on content I would like to add eventually. Some paths lead on to nowhere, but that's OK.

The list on the left side is the closest thing to an organized flow. It is based on folders for the big themes. There are plenty of internal links within the pages themselves. At the bottom of each page is a list of notes that link to that particular page. In this way, you can move forward and backward (or even sideways) through the content. Finally, on the right side (if your screen is big enough) is a nifty graph that shows a visual relationship between notes. You can use any and all of these methods to get around.

Please enjoy wandering through my garden. If something interests you, please stop and spend some time savoring the ideas. If you have something to add, please send me a note.

Any errors, mistakes, or omissions in these notes are regrettably mine.
